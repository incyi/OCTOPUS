What is it?

news: featured in c't 2018/14 - and winner of the blue ribbon of Make:

OCTOPUS was inspired while working over years and on tons of projects - this board is based on the famous ESP8266 and combines the most trilling extensions like SeeedStudio Grove Sensors and Adafruit Feather Wings while being Arduino IDE compatible. So an easy start is ensured!
Why did you make it?

Typcial IoT projects are demanding communication / sensors / power management ... all that has to be wired up or folks need to develop their own custom PCBs. We mixed and meshed up the most important bits and pieces together in this unique kit!
What makes it special?

    1x ESP8266 including UBS/UART, power options(*) to run in 20uA sleep mode for extended battery lifetime
    2x RGBW NeoPixel on board
    2x Grove pinout (analog and I2C, make sure they are on 3V only!)
    1x Adafruit compatible FeatherWing pinout (tested: NeoPixel-, 7-Segment-, Charlie Wings), header included
    1x Bosch Sensortec BME680 (Gas/VOC, Humidity, Barometer, Temperatur)
    credit card size
    attaching a key holder turns it into a wearable or event badge
    use banana plugs to interact with OCTOPUS, it is ready for it!
    use alligator clips to interact with OCTOPUS, it is ready for it!
    variety for power sources: 2xAAA, LiPo (charger on board), Solar charging via USB, charging via USB

    stunning 921000 baud rate for flashing via the Arduino(TM) IDE

    the external analog is fine to run on 3V/VCC voltage level.

need to cut some jumpers to reduce power consumption, this is for field installation and pros only! displays as shown are NOT included (!)

Adafruit CharlieWing, rotary encoder are NOT included in this limited special but you can easily add them yourself, all parts are available via www.adafruit.com / www.exp-tech.de

the badge is not a serial product, R&D - experimental/evaluation use only, before using it make sure that you comply to your country local regulations - thanks, also we can not foresee what modifications you will do.
